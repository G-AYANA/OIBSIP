     In 3228 BCE in Mathura, India, a child was born who was destined to reshape the  spiritual and temporal destiny of mankind—Sri Krishna. 
     In his 125 years of life, Sri Krishna made an indelible impression upon mankind’s collective consciousness—re-educating the world about devotion and dharma as well as the
      ultimate reality.
    
     His life was a model for people in days past, the modern world and surely for those in ages to come. 
     Seeing Krishna as a perfect personification of divinity,to this day hundreds of millions of people pray to him, chant his names, meditate on his form and try to put his
      teachings into practice. 
     His life has inspired a treasure house of poetry, music, painting, sculpture and other fine arts.

     A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis… Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles—the 
     whole time never forgetting that they were just that, roles and that his true nature was  eternal, ever blissful consciousness.In this way, he was able to remain detached 
     and thus perform flawlessly, never allowing the smile to fall from his face.This is perhaps his greatest teaching. 
     There have been very few who have  been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,Sri Krishna is  one who celebrated both life and death. That is why he was always 
     able to give a big smile.He conveyed through his life is that  life should be made full of laughter.

     Krishna’s life was so full, it would be impossible to recount it all here.
           It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam,  Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata,Harivamsa and several other puranas.
           Krishna’s instructions were not just for monks. He advised everyone to his capacity. His instruction to Arjuna, in fact, was to remain in the world, performing his 
           dharma. “His life was a perfect example of how to remain unscorched in the midst of the worldly fire.  
           He shows how to succeed in life while remaining in the midst of obstacles. The Lord doesn’t advise us to turn away from our relationships in order to attain 
           Self-realization. 
           He explains that we should be free from all attachments while still maintaining loving relationships and upholding our family responsibilities.”

           Krishna, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be  killed by his 
     sister Devaki’s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child 
     off to safety. 
     This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda.
      It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis,
     the cowherds of the village. “By spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan—playing with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk,etc—what he actually 
     was doing was stealing their hearts,” Amma says.
     It is from this that Krishna was given the name “Chitta Chora” [one who steals the mind].
          Kamsa sent many assassins to kill Krishna, but none of them were able to do so. And in the end, Krishna returned to Mathura and killed Kamsa, restoring dharma to the land.
 
           Lord Krishna left his physical form at 125 at the hands of a hunter. But he died as he was born and as he lived—with a beatific smile upon his face. In fact it is said that 
           his final act was to bless the hunter who had accidentally shot him. Such was his love.
           
           Throughout his life, Lord Krishna had to face different crises that arose like waves, one after the other. Even then, not once was his countenance clouded by sorrow. 
           He faced every difficulty under the sun, but there was no place for sorrow in Sri Krishna’s presence. He was the embodiment of bliss. In his company everyone rejoiced, 
           forgetting all else. In his presence they tasted the bliss of the Self. Even now, after all this time, the mere thought of him fill us with bliss.
